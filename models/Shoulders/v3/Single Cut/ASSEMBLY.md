# Assembly for Double Cut Shoulder

## Step 1: Insert Carbon Fiber Rod (Optional)
For extra stiffness, cut a 3x6 Carbon Fiber bar until you have 1x 50mm length of it. 

Locate the rectangular hole on the bottom of the shoulder

Make sure that any support material in this hole has been removed.  It's a tight fit. 

Put some CA glue in that hole. 

Using a small hammer, tap in the 3x6 Carbon Fiber Bars until they are fully seated in the shoulder. 

## Step 2: Tap 2020

Tap the end of the 2020 with a M6 Tap

Repeat for the other 2020

## Step 4: Mount Shoulder to 2020

Using 2x M6x20 screws, mount the Shoulder to the top of the 2020's. 

Using 3x M5 Slide In Nuts and 3x M5x16 SHCS, secure the front of the shoulder to the 2020. 

## Step 5: Mount Neck

Using 4x M5x35 SHCS and 4x M5 Slide In Nuts, attach the neck to the shoulder.
