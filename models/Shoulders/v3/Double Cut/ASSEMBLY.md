# Assembly for Double Cut Shoulder

## Step 1: Insert Carbon Fiber Rods (Optional)
For extra stiffness, cut a 3x6 Carbon Fiber bar until you have 2x 90mm lengths of it. 

Locate the rectangular holes on the bottom of the shoulder that don't have balled corners.

Make sure that any support material in those holes has been removed.  It's a tight fit. 

Put some CA glue in those holes. 

Using a small hammer, tap in the 3x6 Carbon Fiber Bars until they are fully seated in the shoulder. 

## Step 2: Tap 2020

Tap the end of the 2020 with a M6 Tap

Repeat for the other 2020

## Step 3: Drill Side Holes

Using a M6x20 BHCS, secure the smaller drill jig to the top of the 2020

Using a M5 drill bit, drill a hole straight through the 2020 using the drill jig as a guide

Swap to the larger hole'd drill bit

Using a M10 Drill bit, drill just the outer edge of the rail away so the screw can nestle inside of the 2020 rail.

Remove the drill Jig

Repeat for the other 2020

## Step 4: Mount Shoulder to 2020

Using 2x M6x20 screws, mount the Shoulder to the top of the 2020's. 

Put two M5 Nuts in the square holes in the face of the shoulder

Finally, put two M5x35 screws through the 2020's into the shoulder until they thread into the nuts from the last step. 

## Step 5: Mount Neck

Using 5x M5x35 SHCS and 5x M5 Slide In Nuts, attach the neck to the shoulder.
