# Assembly for Neck v3 (Fret Inserts)

## Step 0: Prepare hardware

### 2020 Aluminum
- Cut one section of 2020 to 500mm.
- Tap one end of the 2020 with M5 or M6 thread depending on your 2020's hole size

### Threaded Rods
- Cut two pieces of M3 Threaded rod to 480mm
- Put a dot of Locktite on one end of the Threaded Rod and then screw one of the M3 Acorn Nuts onto that end until it's snug

### Metal Frets

For each fret insert:

- Put a dab of glue into the Fret Insert Groove
- affix the fret into the groove in the fret insert so it sticks out of both ends equally.
- Using some metal snips, trim off any of *the back* of the fret that may be sticking out of the fret insert.  Do not trim the front at this point

## Step 1: Insert Heat Set Inserts
Insert two heat set inserts into the first chunk

## Step 2: Assemble fret board onto M3 Threaded Rods

### Step 2a: First Chunk

Starting with the very bottom fret chunk (the one that has two recesses in it for nuts), put the two M3 threaded rods through the holes so that the M3 Acorn nuts rest in the recesses in the bottom chunk

### Step 2b: All the rest of them

It will help to organize your pieces so that you have them grouped by number.  Fret Insert, TPU pad, and Fret Chunk. 

Now put the rest of the pieces on the M3 threaded rods in this order: 

1. Fret Insert, number facing up
2. TPU pad, number facing up, 
3. Fret Chunk, flat side facing up
4. Repeat until all frets are on the M3 Threaded Rods.

### Step 2c: Tighten
Using a 5.5mm nut bit on the M3 Acorn Nuts, tighten the M3 Threaded Rods into the Heat Set Inserts in the first fret chunk until all pieces are snug together and there are no visible gaps between them. 

## Step 3: Insert Fret Indicators

_Note: If you choose to use lighting, replace any mention of "filament piece" with "Fiber Optic Tube" in this section_

### Step 3a: Optional Lighting

- Remove the adhesive backing from the 5mm strip light and stick it in the front-facing channel of the 2020.

### Step 3b: Front Indicators

_if you choose to use lighting, make sure that these pieces were printed in a translucent filament_

- Put a drop of Medium or Thick CA glue into the front indicator hole, and then put the front indicator in the hole so that the indicator is flush with the surface of the neck.  
- Repeat for all pieces
- Allow to dry before proceeding

### Step 3c: Side Indicators

- Cut yourself a decently sized piece of filament in your neck accent color
- insert the piece in the side of one of the holes on the neck.  
  - If it doesn't go in easily, bore the hole using a 2mm drill bit.  
  - _if you are using lighting, make sure that it's going in one side and out the other, as it needs to pass over the channel in the middle of the 2020_
  - if it's loose, pull it out, put in a tiny amount of thin CA glue, and then put it back in
- Trim it so it's flush.
- Repeat for all other holes. 
- If you used glue, allow to dry before proceeding

## Step 4: Insert 2020

- Make sure you have already affixed your head to the 2020 using it's assembly documentation. 
- Align the assembled fretboard so that the first neck chunk is directly underneath the head and facing the same direction
- Push the top of the neck onto the 2020 until it's fully seated.  It will be snug.
- Move down the neck and push until the entire neck is on the 2020
- Put a M5 Slide In Nut in the bottom of the 2020 and tilt / shake the neck until it's hole is visible through the top hole in the side of the neck.
- Use a M5x10 BHCS Screw to secure that neck chunk to the 2020.
- Repeat the last two steps for each screw hole in the sides of the fretboard.
